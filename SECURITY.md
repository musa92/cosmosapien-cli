## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. Email Security Team
Send an email to our security team at: **security@cosmosapien.dev**

### 3. Include Required Information
Your report should include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and severity
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a proof of concept
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, package versions
- **Timeline**: Any constraints on disclosure timeline

### 4. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

### 5. Disclosure Process
- We will work with you to validate and reproduce the issue
- Once confirmed, we will develop and test a fix
- We will coordinate disclosure timing with you
- A security advisory will be published on GitHub

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **API Key Security**: Never commit API keys to version control
3. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for all API communications
5. **Access Control**: Limit API key permissions to minimum required

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
4. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
5. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **API Key Encryption**: All API keys are encrypted using system keyring
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API communications use HTTPS
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies

### Security Tools

- **Bandit**: Static security analysis
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated security checks
- **CI/CD Security**: Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Vulnerability Types

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data exposure
- API key compromise

### High
- Privilege escalation
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Data manipulation

### Medium
- Input validation issues
- Error handling problems
- Performance issues
- Configuration problems

### Low
- Documentation issues
- UI/UX problems
- Non-security bugs

## Security Updates

### Release Process
1. Security issues are addressed in private branches
2. Fixes are thoroughly tested
3. Security patches are released promptly
4. Users are notified through GitHub releases
5. CVE numbers are requested when appropriate

### Update Notifications
- Security releases are marked clearly in GitHub
- Critical updates are announced via GitHub releases
- Users are encouraged to update immediately for critical issues

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Timing is coordinated between reporter and maintainers
3. **Credit**: Security researchers are credited in advisories
4. **Timeline**: Reasonable time is given for fixes to be developed and deployed

## Security Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@cosmosapien.dev
- **Maintainers**: team@cosmosapien.dev
- **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
